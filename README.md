# ifirc

Runs a proxy that lets you connect to IFMUD using an IRC client.

Run with `lein run` or `java -jar`. Use `lein run -- --help` for options. Running with no arguments will give you a proxy listening on port 4000, connecting to ifmud.port4000.com:4000 and automatically running the `lounge` command on connect.

Connect with an IRC client using NICK and PASS matching your username and password on IFMUD. If all goes well, it will autojoin three channels - `##IFMUD`, `##raw`, and `##channels`. (If all does *not* go well -- in particular, if the login fails -- you will be disconnected with an error message).

It should handle multiple concurrent users just fine, but this has not been rigorously tested.

## ##raw

This channel is the raw log; anything you type there is sent, unmodified, to the MUD. It contains all traffic to (indicated with `<<`) and from (`>>`) the MUD. Since a lot of this traffic will include your nick, you may want to configure your IRC client not to generate nick highlights in this channel.

## ##IFMUD

`##IFMUD` is the "main channel". Most non-channel traffic from the MUD will be sent there. Local conversation and emotes will be translated into IRC messages; other MUD traffic shows up as messages from the user "*". Anything you say here will be turned into speech in the mud (with the `"` command), and `/me` will be turned into emotes. To send a raw command without switching back to `##raw`, prefix it with \, as in `\look`.

## ##channels

##channels contains all channel traffic not routed to a separate IRC channel (see below). Channel messages appear to come from an IRC user with the same name as the channel, and are prefixed with the name of the person speaking. (I am open to suggestions on how to make this more readable.)

The topic shows you what channel you're currently talking on; messages you type in will be sent to that MUD channel. Type just a channel name (e.g. `#programming`) to switch to it, or a channel name and a message (e.g. `#programming Hi everyone!`) to switch to it and immediately send that message.

As with `##IFMUD`, you can use `\` to send raw commands, but for most commands the replies will end up in `##IFMUD`, not `##channels`.

## Whispers/queries

Whispers from people on the MUD will turn into IRC query/private message windows, and replying to them (in those windows or using `/msg`) will be translated into whispers to them on the MUD.

## Creating IRC channels from MUD channels

If you `/join` an IRC channel, *and you are already in that channel on the MUD*, traffic on that channel will be split off from `##channels`, making it behave like a normal IRC channel. To merge it with `##channels` again, simply /part it. This will not automatically `@joinc` or `@leavec` on the MUD; you must do this yourself. (To change this behaviour, see the `--autojoin` and `--autochan` options, below.)

(The reason this behaviour is the default, rather than simply `JOIN`ing you to all your MUD channels when you connect, is that it's quite common to be present in a large number of low-traffic channels in the MUD. This way, you can split the high-traffic channels into their own tabs while leaving the low-traffic ones consolidated.)

## --autoexec

If the `--autoexec=CMD` option is provided, the proxy will send `CMD` to the mud, verbatim, whenever a user connects. To send multiple commands, separate them with newlines, as in:

    lein run -- --autoexec='lounge
    say I HAVE RETURNED!
    :bows.'

(Note: you should probably not actually do the above. It is provided solely for illustrative purposes.)

## --autojoin and --autochan

These options change how the proxy handles IRC /join and /part commands. By default, they change the routing of channel messages but will not automatically join or part channels on the MUD proper.

If `--autojoin` is set, /joining a channel in IRC automatically issues the corresponding `@joinc` command in the MUD. This will probably become the default behaviour at some point.

If `--autochan` is set, /join works the same as with `--autojoin` and, furthermore, /part will cause a `@leavec` command to be issued.

## Known Issues

There is no support for /list.

It does not handle user lists particularly well. It tries to guess who is in your vicinity (in ##IFMUD) or in the same channel (in individual channels), but it often gets it wrong and is not good at keeping track of people joining or leaving.
