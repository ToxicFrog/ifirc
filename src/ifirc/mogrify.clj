  Each mogrification has the form
    (re [args] body)
  and is compiled into a function f that when called as (f line), evaluates (re-matches re line). If the result is nil,
  it returns false. Otherwise, it binds the result(s) to args and evaluates body.

  There are two special values that body can evaluate to. :continue causes the mogrification to evaluate to false,
  causing (domogs) to fall through to the next one. :exit causes the entire mogrifier to exit, disconnecting the
  associated user.

  If the body evaluates to neither of these values, it is forced to true.

  The resulting list is intended for use with (domogs) and (mogrify)."
